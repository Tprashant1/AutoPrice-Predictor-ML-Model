# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Overview
Car Price Prediction is a Machine Learning project that estimates the price of a car based on various features such as manufacturing year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and brand. The model is trained using Linear Regression and provides accurate price predictions based on user input.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Accurate Price Prediction** – Predicts car prices based on multiple parameters.
✅ **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** – Handles missing data, categorical variables, and feature scaling.
✅ **Trained using Linear Regression** – A simple yet effective algorithm for price estimation.
✅ **Visualization of Data Trends** – Displays insights into relationships between car attributes and prices.
✅ **User-Friendly Interface** – Easy-to-use Streamlit web app for price prediction.
✅ **Lightweight & Efficient** – Minimal dependencies ensure smooth performance.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud (or any preferred hosting platform)

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains crucial features that influence car prices, including:
✔ **Year** – Manufacturing year of the car

✔ **Mileage** – Fuel efficiency (km per liter or miles per gallon)
✔ **Fuel Type** – Petrol, Diesel, Electric, etc.
✔ **Transmission** – Manual or Automatic
✔ **Car Model & Brand** – Name and manufacturer
✔ **Engine Capacity** – Power of the engine in CC
✔ **Max Power** – Maximum BHP output
✔ **Number of Seats** – Seating capacity of the car
✔ **Seller Type** – Individual, Dealer, or Trustmark Dealer
✔ **Ownership History** – First, Second, or multiple owners

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ankit-78/car-price-prediction.git
cd car-price-prediction
```

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 3: Run the Model Locally**
To test the model and make predictions, execute:
```bash
python predict.py
```

### **Step 4: Run the Streamlit Web App**
To launch the interactive web app for predictions, run:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🎯 Usage
1. **Provide car details** – Enter year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, etc.
2. **Predict the Price** – The model processes the inputs and estimates the car's price.
3. **Visualize Insights** – Get additional insights and price trends based on historical data.

## 📉 Model Performance
- **Training Accuracy:** High precision achieved using Linear Regression.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) for validation.
- **Data Visualization:** Graphs to showcase the relationship between car features and prices.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Improve accuracy with advanced ML models like Random Forest or XGBoost.
🔹 Expand dataset for better generalization.
🔹 Implement real-time price comparison with market data.
🔹 Deploy as a fully functional API for external integrations.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project serves as an effective tool for estimating car prices using Machine Learning. The interactive web app enhances user experience, making it easy to predict prices with minimal inputs. Contributions and suggestions for improvements are always welcome!
